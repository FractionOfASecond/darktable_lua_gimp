# Export / reimport (and Gimp) lua script for Darktable 2.x

This script is a simple hack to export and reimport the image in a roll.

After reimport, you can open the image with gimp.

Alternatively, you can open directly in gimp (configuring a shotcut in the preferences)

Pay attention to [this](http://www.darktable.org/2011/03/why-gimp-doesn%E2%80%99t-play-well-with-darktable/) page, before open images in gimp.

Tested with darktable 2.0
